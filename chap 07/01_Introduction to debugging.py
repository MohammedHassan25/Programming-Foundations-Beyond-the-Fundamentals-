# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The process of identifying and fixing bugs is known as debugging
# The are three main types of bugs in computer programs : (Syntax Error, Run-Time Error, Logic Error)
# Syntax Error : Code that doesn't match the rules of the language
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# for example in Syntax Error
# name "Mohammed Hassan"          # there is not (=)

# for example in Run-Time Error
# def age(Mohammed):
#     if age < 21:
#        print("you're young")        
# age(20)

# for example in Logic Error
# i = 100000000000
# while i > 0:
#     i += 1
#     print(i)
